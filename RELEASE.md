Release type: major

This version introduces support for the reStructuredText markup format. Thanks to Mark Shroyer for implementing it. The plugin documentation in the `README.md` file has been updated accordingly. Additionally, the documentation's wording and grammar have been improved.

Non-user-visible improvements:
- Compliance with Python linters' recommendations
- Improved argument processing of the setUp() method of the unit tests
- Using BeautifulSoup instead of regular expressions when asserting the results of the unit tests
